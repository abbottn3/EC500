# EC500_C1_HW2 Code Review Exercise by Qinjin JIA

  Please check the Peer's **Issues** for the Comprehensive **Code Review**.
  
  There is an **cross-platform problem** of peer's code, and I **CANNOT** solve the problem :boom::boom::boom:

  As Osama said that if people are having **too much trouble** making the programs **work cross platform**, you can just do the **test cases for your own program** and only do the **text peer review on peer's project**.

 :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation: Therefore, I would do the **test cases for my own program** and **only do the text peer review on  peer's API assignment** :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation
