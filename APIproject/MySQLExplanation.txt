So I have spent a ton of time getting to know MySQL because I thought I had to implement the entire past code with this databse method,
but it turns out I could have just done phase 1. Oh well. Now I know how it works though. The main difference between the two is obviously
about how the data is stored. In MySQL, data is stored relationally, and requires much more structure in order to enter the data in.
I learned this the hard way, as if you try to just throw data in without a well planned schema, there are a lot of errors. MongoDB on the
other hand allows you to create documents and add fields as you go, as the data in there isn't quite as organized.
Another noticeable difference is ease of use. MySQL working in python is NOT robust. It is very confusing and the documentation is all over
the place. Many programs needed to be downloaded, including a lot of erroneous errors that should not have been flagged in the first place.
MongoDB on the other hand just had a few easy "pip installs" and it was ready to go. Overall, I'm sure MySQL is a helpful database program
for large quantities of data that need to be properly organized for efficiency's sake, but in this case I think that MongoDB has been an
overall easier and more effective tool.
