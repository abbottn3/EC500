# API Project Peer Review

I reviewed and tested the code of ASurette at https://github.com/ASurette/EC500-Designing-Software/tree/peer_review/MiniProject1
under the the peer_review branch.

CodeReview.txt explains the findings of the testing (testingScript.py) and explains the errors and overall review of his API.
Additionally, a few small edits were made to the TwitterImageDownload.py program in order to properly use it with my own computer.
TIDWebpage.py is a program I created that uses his API to create a webpage with the video and description results.

Note: Some of the authorization processes in TwitterImageDownload are hardcoded to work with my personal computer. In order to
properly run TIDWebpage, certain variables need to be customized.
